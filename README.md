# UDP-client_server-pratice


There are two (.py) files, one named UDPclient, and the other named UDPserver.

UDPclient:   (using CMD to open it)
        firstly, Input a english sentence. Then, the sentence will be sent to the UDPserver, and convert it to an ASCii string.  
        finally, the ASCii string will be sent back and print.
UDPserver:   (open it directly)
        Server waits until receiving the english sentence. Converting the english sentence to an ASCii string, Server 
        sends it back. Server will wait again.
